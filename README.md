CTREK
 
 Tradtional Star Trek game in C
 
 You are in one of 8x8 Quadrants. Each Quadrant is divided into 8x8 sectors.
 Each sector can contain a star, klingon, base, your ship.
 
 You have a number of bases for repair and refueling. Your opponents mean to
 remove all these.
 
 Right now - you can move from sector to sector, move to a different quadrant,
 employ your phasers or torpeods to destroy your opponents. Moving to a sector
 next to a base will allow refueling and replenishment.
 
 Klingons dont do anything just yet... work in progress.
 
 Make the program-
 Make ctrek should work as this is a very simple program so far.
 
Enter commands by pressing a letter followed by two digits (usually 1-8 for most commands to corrispond to x,y coordinates of
secotor or quadrant or 0-9 for phaser %. Follow that with a <cr>. So to Warp to quadrant 5,6 type W 5 6 <cr>. 
'h' prints a list of commands.
